## Overview & Quick Start

### What is TM-Flash?

TM-Flash is a lightweight, web-based flashcard application designed specifically for learning Chinese vocabulary. It uses a sophisticated Spaced Repetition System (SRS) to help you learn efficiently by showing you cards at the optimal time for retention.

### Getting Started in 30 Seconds

1. **Open the App**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser
2. **Select a Deck**: Choose from Deck A (beginner) to Deck D (advanced) using the dropdown in the header
3. **Start Reviewing**: The app will show you your first card immediately
4. **Flip & Answer**: Click the card or press Space to flip, then mark your answer as Correct or Incorrect

That's it! The app will automatically track your progress and show you the most important cards next.

### System Requirements

- **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)
- **JavaScript Enabled**: Required for all functionality
- **Device**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile phones
- **Internet**: Initial deck loading requires connection (works offline after first load)

---

## Core Features

### Multi-Deck System

TM-Flash includes four pre-loaded decks, each designed for different proficiency levels:

- **Deck A**: Basic words and phrases (beginner)
- **Deck B**: Elementary vocabulary (HSK 2-3 level)
- **Deck C**: Intermediate words (HSK 3-4 level)
- **Deck D**: Advanced vocabulary (HSK 4+ level)

Each deck maintains its own statistics and progress, so you can work with multiple levels simultaneously.

### Bidirectional Learning

Study in both directions:
- **Chinese ‚Üí English (CH‚ÜíEN)**: See Chinese characters and pinyin, recall English meaning
- **English ‚Üí Chinese (EN‚ÜíCH)**: See English, recall Chinese characters and pinyin

The direction toggle in the header lets you switch instantly, and each direction tracks separate statistics.

### Spaced Repetition System (SRS)

The intelligent SRS algorithm prioritizes cards based on:
- **New cards**: Shown first to introduce new vocabulary
- **Error rate**: Cards you struggle with appear more frequently
- **Time since last review**: Cards due for review are prioritized
- **Random tie-breaking**: Small randomization prevents predictability

This ensures you spend time on the cards that need the most attention.

## How to Use

### Review Mode

The Review mode is where you'll spend most of your time learning.

#### Card Display

Each card is displayed as a table with four rows:
1. **Hanzi**: Chinese characters (one per cell)
2. **Pinyin**: Pronunciation guide with tone marks
3. **English Words**: Individual word translations
4. **English Translation**: Complete sentence meaning

#### Direction-Based Display

- **CH‚ÜíEN Direction**: Initially shows only Hanzi and Pinyin rows
- **EN‚ÜíCH Direction**: Initially shows only English Words and Translation rows
- **After Flipping**: All four rows become visible

#### Answering Cards

1. **Study the visible information** based on your chosen direction
2. **Flip the card** to see the complete information
3. **Mark your answer**:
   - **Correct (Green)**: You knew the answer well
   - **Incorrect (Red)**: You struggled or didn't know

The app automatically advances to the next card after you mark your answer.

### Statistics View

Track your learning progress with detailed statistics.

#### Available Metrics

- **Total Cards**: Number of cards in the current deck
- **Reviewed Cards**: Cards you've practiced at least once
- **New Cards**: Cards you haven't studied yet

- **Top 10 Best**: Your best-performing cards by accuracy
- **Top 10 Worst**: Cards that need more practice

#### Direction-Specific Stats

Statistics are tracked separately for each direction (CH‚ÜíEN and EN‚ÜíCH). Use the direction toggle in the stats view to switch between them.

#### Resetting Stats

You can reset statistics for the current deck and direction using the "Reset Stats" button. This is useful if you want to start fresh with a deck.

4. **Jump to Card**: Click any result to go directly to that card in Review mode

#### Search Tips

- Pinyin search is tone-insensitive: "yao" matches "y√†o", "y«éo", etc.
- English search matches both individual words and full translations
- Results update in real-time as you type

### Deck Management

Switch between decks seamlessly while maintaining separate progress.

#### Switching Decks

### How SRS Prioritizes Cards

The Spaced Repetition System uses a scoring algorithm that considers:

1. **New Cards** (Weight: 5.0): Unstudied cards get highest priority
2. **Error Rate** (Weight: 3.0): Cards you often get wrong appear more frequently
3. **Days Since Review** (Weight: 0.25): Cards not reviewed recently get priority
4. **Random Factor** (Œµ ‚àà [0, 0.01)): Small randomness prevents predictability

**Formula**: `Score = 5.0 √ó isNew + 3.0 √ó errorRate + 0.25 √ó daysSince + Œµ`

The card with the highest score is shown next, ensuring optimal learning efficiency.

## Learning Tips

### Effective Study Habits

#### Consistency Over Intensity

- **Deck Balance**: Ensure you're making progress across all active decks

### Advanced Strategies

#### Star System
